# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — AI-Native Technical Textbook for Panaversity Hackathon I Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technical Accuracy
All content must be technically accurate and aligned with ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and modern humanoid robotics concepts.

### II. Clarity for Learners
Content must be clear and accessible to learners with basic programming knowledge, ranging from Python/AI beginners to intermediate robotics students.

### III. Consistency
The book must be consistent with Panaversity AI-native textbook standards, ensuring a uniform look, feel, and structure.

### IV. Modular and Reusable Content
Content should be generated in a modular and reusable format, suitable for a Docusaurus-based structure.

### V. Structured Writing for RAG
Writing must be structured to be suitable for both human readers and ingestion by a RAG chatbot.

### VI. Progressive Learning Design
The book must follow a progressive learning design, starting from simple concepts and moving to advanced and applied robotics.

### VII. High-Quality Explanations and Examples
Provide high-quality explanations, text-form diagrams, and real-world robotics examples.

## Key Standards

- All explanations must be 100% original (no copying from any copyrighted robotics documentation).
- Use beginner-friendly but technically correct explanations.
- Every chapter must include:
  - Learning objectives
  - Technical breakdowns
  - ROS 2 / Gazebo / Unity / Isaac examples where relevant
  - Small code snippets (Python or ROS 2)
  - Diagrams described in text
  - Assignments or practice tasks
  - Key takeaways
- Writing clarity should match a “technical textbook” tone (Flesch-Kincaid grade 10–12).
- All content must be compatible with Docusaurus markdown.
- Style must be consistent across the entire book.

## Constraints

- No plagiarism (0% tolerance).
- Avoid any copyrighted robot model names unless open-source (e.g., use a generic humanoid robot).
- No claims requiring external citations — the book is self-contained.
- Each chapter should be 800–1500 words.
- Total book size may vary but must remain fully structured and cohesive.
- Must follow Spec-Kit Plus book specification structure (`id`, `title`, `slug`, etc.).
- Output must remain deterministic and reproducible when re-generated.

## Success Criteria

- The book compiles correctly in Docusaurus without formatting errors.
- Every chapter maintains a consistent structure and tone.
- The output is fully usable with RAG chatbot training (clean sections, no mixed formatting).
- All examples are correct and relevant to the course.
- The content is original, clear, and free of factual errors.
- The book completes the full table of contents, exactly matching the course’s modules and weeks.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for the project's standards and principles. All contributions and reviews must adhere to it. Amendments require team consensus and must be documented.
