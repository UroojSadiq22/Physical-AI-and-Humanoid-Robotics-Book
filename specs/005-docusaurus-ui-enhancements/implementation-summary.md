All automatable implementation tasks for the Docusaurus UI enhancements feature have been completed.

-   **Tasks File**: `specs/005-docusaurus-ui-enhancements/tasks.md` has been updated with all tasks marked as complete.
-   **Modified Files**: `docs/docusaurus.config.ts`, `docs/sidebars.ts`.

The Docusaurus build process has been verified to complete without errors.

The following manual steps are required for final validation:
1.  **Visual Inspection**: Perform a full visual inspection of the site on various browsers and screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to confirm all UI fixes and chatbot integration are correct and free of regressions.
2.  **Functional Testing**: Conduct functional testing to ensure navbar, sidebar, homepage, and chatbot open/close mechanisms all work as expected.

You can run `npm run start` in the `docs/` directory to inspect these changes in a local development environment.
